         Many of us suffer from a skin condition called, acne. Most of us have acne around puberty but, some of us have it throughout our whole lives!
         All of your skin, are tiny holes called pores, and inside pores are hair follicles and sebacious glands. Sebacious glands keep your skin healthy 
         and nourished by created a sticky substance (oil) called, sebum. Every day, your skin sheds dead skin cells and sebum travels up the hair follicle 
         onto the outermost area of your skin. When dead skin cells and sebum mix, pimples form! When you have acne, your skin cell turnover is frequent, 
         which means that your new skin cells are pushing up the dead skin cells up, to shed it as fast as possible. As a result, your skin causes an 
         excess amount of dead skin cells, and bacteria known as P.Acnes, causing our bodies to send out white blood cells to deal with them. Then the 
         concoction of dead skin cells, bacteria, and other factors lead to pus filled acne. This is all happening on the surface of our skin, but internally 
         our hormones can signal to the sebacous glands to create excess sebum, causing an increase of dead skin cells getting trapped in the pores. Some internal 
         factors that cause acne, are inflammation inside our bodies. Examples of inflamation, are lack of sleep, stress, food triggers such as sugar, dairy and
         fried foods.

          There are two main types of acne called Non-Inflammatory Acne and Inflammatory Acne. Non-Inflammatory Acne consts of blackhead and whiteheads, which 
          are mostly in the upper layers of the skin. On the other hand, Inflammatory Acne consists of much more painful and scarring acne, that are deep into the skin. 
          These include Papule, Pustule, Nodule, and Cystic Acne where more swelling is involved. Skincare Products out on the market are mostly targeted towards 
          blackheads, whiteheads, papules and pustules since they are less severe. However to treat Nodule and Cystic Acne you may want to seek a Dermatologist.
