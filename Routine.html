                    <h2> Oily and Dry Skin Reccomendations</h2>

                    <p class="generalPadding Oily"> 
                        People with Oily Skin should avoid rich creams, and intense hydration because this could cause your skin to feel really greasy and heavy. Instead, try opting for lighter moisturizers and toners so that your skin still feels well hydrated. Oily skinned people tend to be prone to acne and clogged pores, so I would reccomend trying BHA to clear out all the bacteria causing you acne. I would also reccomend Cleansing Balms/Oils, which remove makeup and grime of your skin, to deeply cleanse the insides of your pores. Oils attract other oils which help dissolve makeup, sunscreens, and excess sebum off our skin. You may want to reach for Cleansing Balms rather than Cleansing Oils, since they tend to be more lightweight on the skin. I would

                    <p class="generalPadding CausesAcne Dry">
                        If you have Dry Skin, you should avoid the opposite of Oily skinned people. You <i> want </i> rich creams that deliver intense moisture to your skin so that you won't experience tightness, and irritation. Personally, I would reccomend using essence rather than toner, because essences are usually more thicker than toners. Dry skinned people tend to not experience breakouts or acne, maybe just an occasional pimple or two, I would not reccomend using harsh retionols or exfoliants. If you really want to, use them in moderation and build up your tolerance.
