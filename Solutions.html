            <h2> Chemcial Exfoliants </h2>
            
            <p class="generalPadding CausesAcne">  
                One acne solution is using chemical exfoliants. Chemical exfoliants may sound like a very harsh way to treat acne, but it is actually one of the most gentle solution. When people use scrubs, such as ST.Ives, can cause long-term damage to yor skin. This is because scrubs create micro-tears in the skin, small rips, eventually leading to scarring.Chemical Exfoliants on the other hand, just cleans the surface area and your pores without tearing or causing scars. There are three main types of chemical exfoliants called alpha-hydroxy acids (AHA), beta-hydroxy acids (BHA), and polyhydroxy acids (PHA).

            <h2>Pimple Patch Stickers</h2>

            <p class="generalPadding CausesAcne"> 
                A second solution is using pimple patch stickers. There are three main pimple patch types, a patch filled with active ingredients, microdarts, and just a normal sticker. Pimples patches absorb excess gunk and protects pimple from external factors, such as UV/UVB Rays and bacteria.Pimple patches are made up a material that contains a gel forming agent such as pectin or gelatin. These agents form a barrier from the outside and speeds up the healing process of acne.

            <h2> Sunscreen </h2>

            <p class="generalPadding CausesAcne"> 
                Something to remember is using sunscreen every single day, no matter if it is sunny outside. UVA, UVB, and UVC stil exist and can cause permanent skin damage, and other skin issues. Not using sunscreen can cause your acne to lead to hyperpigmentation since UV rays can penetrate your skin. As a result, your skin can become inflammed and form new breakouts. If you are using retinols, exfoliants, prescribed medication, you <b>MUST</b> use sunscreen because the sun can cause extreme irritation to the skin. If you really don't believe me, think about the dark cloudy and snowy days in the winter. Snow and rain reflects all these rays at your skin which increases the chances of prolonged skin damage. A benefit of sunscreen is that it can slow down skin aging. Your skin will be protected by external factors in the world that lead to skin aging. So if you are fifteen years old now, by the time you are twice the age, you won't even look as old as you actually are. It's like reversing time!

            <h2> Seek Proffesional Help </h2>

            <p class="generalPadding CausesAcne"> 
                The last solution I would reccomend is meeting a proffesional or dermatologist. If you've tried absolutely everything that is targeted to acne, you might want to seek proffesional help. Dermatologists will usually prescribe medication and topical treatments you won't be able to find over the counter at a drug store. These may include Tretinoin, Isotretinoin/Accutane, and oral drugs to help fight severe cystic or nodule acne. They will usually prescribe you the most gentle product suitable for your acne, and see if that will help clear it. If that doesn't work, they will try building up to more stronger and potent products. In my personal experience, my very last product every prescribed by a dermatologist, was Isotretinoin/Accutane. This product is a very extreme and serious product that most people will not resort to right away, as it is one of the most strongest products to use. Isotretinoin/Accutane can cause dangerous side effects including, dry eyes, dizziness, bone pain, hair loss, extremely dry hands and lips, migraines, and even suicide. However, most people do just fine with this product and only experience the most common side effect, dryness.
